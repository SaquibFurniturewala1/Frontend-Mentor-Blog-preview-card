# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is a solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

The Blog Preview Card project is a front-end coding challenge that focuses on creating a visually appealing card layout to showcase blog posts. The objective is to replicate the design provided by Frontend Mentor as closely as possible while ensuring responsiveness and interactivity. This project enhances my skills in HTML and CSS, particularly in areas like Flexbox, responsive design, and styling interactive elements. Users should be able to see hover and focus states for all interactive components, ensuring a polished user experience.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a responsive blog preview card that includes an image, title, description, and meta information (like author name and date).
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Ensure that the layout adapts well to different screen sizes, maintaining usability and aesthetics.
- Implement proper semantic HTML for accessibility.


- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use `max-width` and `min-width` properties in CSS. These properties allowed me to create a responsive design that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Additionally, mastering these properties improved the efficiency of my Flexbox layouts, enabling me to create more flexible and user-friendly components. Overall, this challenge enhanced my understanding of responsive design principles and CSS best practices.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue refining my skills in CSS layout techniques, particularly with Flexbox and Grid. I aim to explore more advanced concepts such as CSS animations and transitions to enhance user interactivity. Additionally, I would like to improve my proficiency in JavaScript to implement dynamic features in my projects. This will help me create more engaging and interactive user experiences as I progress in my front-end development journey.
